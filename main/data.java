Look in my eyes
What do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you want to be
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality
Neon lights, a Nobel prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free
I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face on your TV
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you, still you love me
I tell you, one and one makes three
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi
I'm the cult of personality
The cult of personality
The cult of personality
Neon lights, a Nobel prize
When a leader speaks, that leader dies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set you free
You gave me fortune, you gave me fame
You gave me power in your god's name
I'm every person you need to be
Oh, I'm the cult of personality
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of personality
Ask not what your country can do for you
The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself""","""
Wrestling has more
than one royal family
Adrenaline in my soul
Every fight out of control
Do it all to get them off their feet
Crowd is here, about to blow
Waitin' for me to start the show
Out the curtain, lights go up
I'm home (whoa)
My father said
"When I was younger
Hard times breed better men"
(Better men)
You took it all away, I give it all away
Can't take my freedom
Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
I built my kingdom
Now you bow to me
You took my dreams but not my name
You'll follow me until the end
I am my kingdom
Lights go down, I'm ready now
Tear this roof off for the town
Gonna give 'em what they came to see
Hear the crowd, on their toes
Ready for me to start the show
Out the curtain, lights go up
I'm home (whoa)
And my father said
"When I was younger
Hard times breed better men"
(Better men)
You took it all away, I give it all away
Can't take my freedom
Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
I built my kingdom
Now you bow to me
You took my dreams but not my name
You'll follow me until the end
I am my kingdom
You tried to tell me what to do
I saw the door and kicked it down
I stepped right over and right through
And you can never stop me now
Bow, now
I am the king and you're the crown
Now watch me as I take my throne
And rule my kingdom
You took it all away, I give it all away
Can't take my freedom
Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
I built my kingdom
Now you bow to me
You took my dreams but not my name
You'll follow me until the end
I am my kingdom
You took it all away, I give it all away
Can't take my freedom
Here to change the game, a banner made of pain
I built my kingdom
Now you bow to me
You took my dreams but not my name
You'll follow me until the end

Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive
They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones, they'll run into smoke
When the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you (they become a part of you)
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
The scars collected all of their lives
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts
And avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm
Just to touch a dream
Oh, pick yourself up, 'cause
Legends never die
When the world is calling you (when the world is calling you)
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die

Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more

Laid back, there's no need to hide
Watchin' TV with the gun at my side
There's no time to make a decision
I have to pay dues for the life I've been livin'
I can't stop, I can't see what's comin'
Goin' through hell with a chainsaw runnin'
Revved up I'm ready to blaze
Got no regrets 'cause it's the end of days
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Worst nightmare you've ever had
Cold steel and a tank of gas
Ridin' through a desert made of broken glass
I see the edge, it's comin' fast
But I don't care if I come in last
Maybe I'm a fool to think that I can make it all the way
With everything against me all my confidence decays
I can hear it in the distance it's the devil's cry
I can see my name written in a burning sky
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad
(I'm bad) I'm bad (I'm bad)
Keepin' it straight in a world gone mad
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad motherfucker, I'm bad

Worst nightmare you've ever had
Run, run away from me
'Cause time is blood, and blood is time
Run, run, run away from me
'Cause it all drains away
I'm not afraid to die
My soul is empty now
The clock, the ticking stops
And we are undone
Nowhere, no one, no, our time, over
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad mother-mother...
We're all gonna die one way or another
So while I'm alive I'll be a bad mother-mother... I'm bad

You are beautiful on the inside
You are innocence personified

Run away

I have carved out this soul made of stone
And I will drag you down and sell you out

Encircled by demons, I fight

I close my eyes
I imagine your world, oh
There's a cloud in the back of my mind
I see you thrive
In the meadows of bliss
But I sense there's a storm on the horizon of your lies
Ooh, open your eyes
The melody of your cries
Resounds in the sky
So I sail away
In this game, everybody's losing
The symphony of your crimes
Echoes in the clouds
As you hide your pain
Peace of mind, you're far away from trying
I see your pride
Trying to be divine, oh
There's a twist in the plot of your crime
A tragedy
The whole world is yours
But I sense there's a hunger in you, you can't satisfy
Ooh, open your eyes

Echoes in the clouds
As you hide your pain
Peace of mind is far away
It all starts like a lullaby
A wonderful once upon a time
But as soon as the sun goes down
Here comes the smell of the rotten flesh again
It goes on with a blade in the heart
Calculation, betraying your own blood
To ascent to a higher ground
You'll carry the weight of your sins
'Til the gates of the underworld
You'll carry the weight of your sins
'Til the gates of the underworld

Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words I guess...
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. "Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine."
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
"Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you."
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, "You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice

Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding."
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
"You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going."
But, baby, wait.
"It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us."
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,

It starts with one
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard
And got so far

I tried so hard

Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard
And got so far

Pushed as far as I can go

Pushed as far as I can go
